abstract: Soil moisture (SM) is a critical parameter in understanding the Earth&#x0027;s
  hydrological cycle and managing water resources. Remote sensing instruments, such
  as Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), can provide valuable long-term SM. However, compatibility
  issues may arise when integrating ASCAT SM retrieval with another retrieval, such
  as Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), a high-quality microwave radiometer-based
  SM retrieval. In this study, we propose a novel image-to-image translation approach
  based on the U-Net architecture to convert ASCAT SM data into the format of SMAP
  (ASCAT2SMAP). The resulting SM from the ASCAT2SMAP was evaluated using temporally
  separated SMAP data and independent in-situ SM measurement from the International
  Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). In the separately divided test periods, ASCAT2SMAP
  showed good agreement with SMAP with R of 928, ubRMSD of 0.043 m3 &#x002F;m3, and
  bias of 0.002 m3 &#x002F;m3. When evaluating ASCAT2SMAP with ISMN data, it showed
  a better agreement than ASCAT and more similar metrics with SMAP. Moreover, we found
  that the ASCAT2SMAP is more robust to a problem of subsurface scattering than the
  original ASCAT SM. When simulating V-polarized brightness temperature from ASCAT2SMAP
  SM, it showed good agreement with ubRMSD of 5.602 K and bias of -0.135 K. Our results
  are expected to provide a valuable perspective preceding to creation of harmonized
  soil moisture datasets from different sensors, contributing to improved data integration
  and analysis in the field of geoscience and remote sensing.
